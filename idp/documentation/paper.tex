	\section{Introduction}
	\label{section:introduction}

		These days, vector graphics are widely used in both artistic and industrial design. Artists create illustrations, character designs and even fully animated cartoons using vector graphics software. Vector graphics are also used in industrial design, allowing for the smooth, aerodynamic shapes observed in modern cars and airplanes.

		Raster graphics images (for instance, digital photos and most digitally painted artworks) consist of a finite number of pixels (picture elements) which discretely specify the colors at each point of the image. In contrast, vector graphics designs consist of primitives like curves and surfaces, which describe the shapes present in the design using continuous mathematical functions. This has various advantages over the raster approach, since designs do not suffer from discretization artifacts and can, for instance, be arbitrarily scaled without any loss of quality.

		The scope of this project is restricted to two-dimensional vector graphics, but many ideas can be applied to three-dimensional vector graphics as well. All elements in two-dimensional vector graphics are described in terms of curves, so the design process of curves is the single most important part of two-dimensional vector graphics. Unfortunately, designing curves using the tools available through current vector graphics software can be very frustrating. The artist is often unable to make the curve look the way they want it to. To make matters worse it is often unclear why this is the case, as the software seems to put all the necessary tools into the hands of the designer, yet at times, they somehow don't allow the artist to communicate their intention to the software. Thus, the objective of this project is to identify the exact nature and cause of these inadequacies and then specify and implement curve design tools that do not exhibit them.

	\section{Problem Analysis}
	\label{section:problem_analysis}

		When trying to improve something, it seems advisable to take a step back and thoroughly research the causes of its perceived shortcomings so as to find a way to improve it without making the same or similar mistakes. In the context of curve design tools, this can be achieved by analyzing and modelling the process that people use when designing curves. Once such a model has been obtained, it can be used to propose criteria for good curve design software as well as to analyze potential usability issues with existing tools.

		\subsection{Curve Design Process}
		\label{section:curve_design_process}

			Observing the process that most people seem to go through when designing curves using vector graphics software, the following model appears plausible:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item obtain the source curve as either a real or a mental image of the curve
				\item extract some properties from the source curve
				\item provide these properties to the software
				\item have the software derive the most likely result curve from these properties
			\end{enumerate}

			Steps 2 to 4 are then repeated on portions of the curve in order to make small adjustments until the result curve is sufficiently similar to the source curve.

			Step 1 is of course independent of any software that may be used by the designer. Step 2 and 3 are strongly influenced by the choice of design tool, in that the software dictates which properties it accepts as specifications for curves (the specification language the software uses). Unless the properties the designer conveyed to the software in step 3 uniquely identify the curve, in step 4, the design tool will have to choose the curve that the user was most likely describing from a possibly infinite set of curves that exhibit the supplied properties. This notion of `most likely' is usually modelled in terms of a fairness measure, fairer curves being regarded as more likely. Fairness ususally encodes intuitive notions such as smoothness using mathematical concepts such as continuity and change in curvature. Here, the software has another opportunity to influence the design process both positively and negatively depending on how the fairness measure is chosen as well as by how good the software is at reliably finding a curve that has a high fairness.

			Note that there may be multiple ways to describe a given curve design tool in terms of this process. Instead of modelling the selection of the most likely curve using some fairness measure, one may also propose an alternate view on the process in which the user implicitly specifies the exact curve they want in the properties they specify. For example, in a curve design tool which takes two points from the user and connects them using a straight line, one may say that the user provides the start and the end point of the curve, and the fairness measure is designed to always select the straight line as the fairest curve. Another way of looking at this process is to say that the user, by supplying \(p_0\) and \(p_1\), specified the coefficients of the linear term \(p_0 + (p_1 - p_0) \cdot t\), thus uniquely identifying the desired curve. Modelling the process in such a way that the user supplies only the minimum amount of implicit information, relying on the fairness measure for everything else, is usually closer to reality when analyzing usability of some curve design tool. In a similar fashion, one may consider shortcomings (for instance insufficient continuity) as either shortcomings of the specification language (the language does not allow the user to request \(G^2\) continuity) or as shortcomings of the fairness measure (the fairness measure does not select sufficiently smooth curves).

		\subsection{Usability Criteria for Curve Design Tools}
		\label{section:usability_criteria_curve_design_tools}

			We conclude that the two ways in which curve design software can affect the design process are through the choice of specification language and fairness measure. Ideally, the specification language should be very expressive, yet easy to handle for humans, enabling the user to communicate their intent to the software efficiently. The fairness should capture the intuitive notion of curve smoothness sufficiently well. These goals are competing with the software's ability to derive curves from specifications and the fairness measure reliably and efficiently, a process which becomes increasingly difficult with more expressive specification languages and more complex fairness measures.

			From these considerations, we think that applying the following criteria is a good start for assessing the usability of curve design tools:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item How efficient is the specification language at describing various curves?
				\item How well can humans `read' the specification language from curves?
				\item How well can humans `speak' the specification language to the software?
				\item How well does the fairness measure capture the intuitive notion of smoothness?
				\item How well can the software derive curves from specifications and a fairness measure?
			\end{enumerate}

		\subsection{Existing Curve Design Tools}
		\label{section:existing_curve_design_tools}

			Using the model of the curve design process as well as the criteria for usability of curve design software that were established in the previous section, various tools available in current vector graphics software can be analyzed.

			\subsubsection{Bézier Splines}
			\label{section:bézier_splines}

				Bézier splines are probably the most widely used type of curve in two-dimensional vector graphics. Bézier splines are defined piecewise using Bézier curves, which are planar parametric curves (functions \(\left[0,1\right] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2\)) realized using polynomials (usually cubic) in Bernstein form. A Bézier curve \(B\) of degree \(n\) consists of \(n + 1\) coefficients \(P_i \in \mathbb{R}^2\). The curve will always go through the first and the last coefficient point (\(B\left(0\right) = P_0, B\left(1\right) = P_n\)) and stay within the convex hull of the coefficient points at all other times. Bézier curves in a Bézier spline are usually pieced together such that the resulting spline is \(G^1\) continuous.

				In existing vector graphics software, Bézier splines are edited by more or less directly modifying the coefficient points of the underlying Bézier curves. In the case of cubic Bézier curves, the first and the last coefficient points represent the curve's start and end points, while the differences between the second and the first as well as the fourth and the third coefficient points are proportional to the velocity of the curve at the start and end points, respectively. In that sense, the user can specify start end end points of the curve, as well as start and end velocities of the curve using the coefficient points. Most vector graphics tools have functions that allow preserving the \(G^1\) continuity of the spline by automatically modifying adjacent coefficient points accordingly. They usually do not ensure \(G^2\) continuity though. Some tools can also modify existing coefficient points in such a way that the curve passes through a point that is chosen by the user without adding more Bézier curves to the spline.

				When applying the model introduced in section \ref{section:curve_design_process} to Bézier spline design tools, there are two possibilities for modelling the fairness measure. One way to view things is to assume that the user, in supplying the four coefficient points of each curve segment, uniquely specifies each segment and thus the entire curve, leaving no room for choosing a curve according to some fairness measure. Since users usually don't think about Bézier splines that way, it is more practical to assume that the user only supplies both point and velocity at the start and end of each curve segment, with a fairness measure designed to always choose the cubic polynomial that is uniquely specified by the given properties as the fairest curve.

				Applying the criteria established in section \ref{section:usability_criteria_curve_design_tools}, we conclude that the design tools for Bézier splines work sufficiently well in terms of humans trying to read and/or speak their specification language (criteria 2 and 3), a skill that can be acquired with some practice. Bézier splines are furthermore very simple to derive from their specification, fulfilling the 5th criterion perfectly. Design tools for Bézier splines have some issues with both the fairness measure (criterion 4) and the expressiveness of the specification language (criterion 1), both of which shall be analyzed in the following paragraphs.

				The issue with the fairness measure is that it always selects the uniquely determined cubic polynomial, thus not guaranteeing \(G^2\) continuity. It is difficult for humans to choose the coefficient points in such a way that \(G^2\) continuity is established, making it hard to create smooth curves if the design software does not support the user in this regard. The problem is aggravated by the fact that curvature discontinuities can be hard to spot and may thus only be discovered much later in the design process, increasing the cost of these mistakes. In case the software allows the user to request \(G^2\) continuous Bézier splines, this sacrifices some degree of freedom for each node, thus restricting the way nodes can be manipulated and in turn possibly forcing the user to place more nodes in order to get the desired result. Placing more nodes leads to some disadvantages that will be discussed further in the paragraphs dealing with specification language expressiveness.

				The specification language used to specify Bézier splines in common design tools is lacking in expressiveness. Specifically, describing curves in terms of their curvature is difficult since curvature may only be specified indirectly through the magnitude of the velocity values (higher velocity resulting in lower curvature). Unfortunately, this is also very dependent on the point and velocity coefficients at the other end of the spline segment. There is also no way to directly specify linearly changing curvature. This makes specifying curvature very tedious, and in case the winding angle of the curve segment is large enough, actually impossible, forcing the designer to use additional nodes in order to get the desired result. Using an excessive number of nodes makes it more tedious and time-consuming for the designer to create and/or modify such curves, since many nodes and handles have to be created or moved in order to change the overall curve. It also sacrifices smoothness, since it's easy to accidently introduce subtle bumps in the curve when using a large number of nodes. Another issue is that without software support for \(G^2\) continuity, using more nodes usually also introduces more points where curvature is not continuous. In cases where the curvature is an important property of the curve (for example the constant curvature of circular arcs, or the linearly changing curvature of spirals), it may be very difficult to specify these properties indirectly using the coefficient points.

					\label{figure:usability_bézier}
				\end{figure}

				% TODO: improve example index numbers
				Figure \ref{figure:usability_bézier} illustrates some of these issues by showing some examples of Bézier splines as they appear in common design tools. Bézier nodes are displayed as filled dots, while Bézier handles are displayed as circles.

				Example 1 shows two Bézier splines. The left curve is a Bézier spline approximation of a circular arc, exhibiting nearly constant curvature, while the right one is not, going from low curvature to high curvature and back to low curvature. Since the difference can be hard to see, it's easy to make mistakes when trying to approximate circular arcs using Bézier splines.

				Examples 2 and 3 show curves that could be described more efficiently in terms of curvature. Since there is no way to directly specify curvature using Bézier splines, a considerable number of nodes is needed to get close to the desired curve. It may be observed that the spiral in example 2 is not perfect. Creating perfect spirals using Bézier splines is very tedious and would require even more nodes (at least one for every 90\textdegree of winding angle covered). It could be speculated on whether the artist would have opted to use a perfect spiral in this example if they had had the tools to efficiently do so.

				% TODO: consider removing the handle markers to make curvature discontinuity more visible
				Example 4 shows a spline with a curvature discontinuity which went unnoticed by the artist at the time of creation. In fact, this discontinuity would be even less visible if the curve were not vertical at said point, manifesting itself only in a reduced overall smoothness of the curve, without a clear indication of where the problem lies.

			\subsubsection{Spiro Splines}
			\label{section:spiro_splines}

				Spiro splines were added to Inkscape in 2009. Even though they were integrated using path effects and thus have a somewhat cumbersome user interface, they constitute a commendable effort of incorporating results from curve research into vector graphics software, something that has hardly happened this far. More information on Spiro splines can be found in the dissertation of Raphael Levien \cite{Levien2009}.

				Spiro splines consist of parts of the Euler spiral, which is a curve whose curvature changes linearly with the curve's arc length. The user can specify control points through which the software puts an interpolating spline. There is no way to directly specify tangent direction and/or curvature. The splines are guaranteed to have \(G^2\) continuity.

				Again, the model from section \ref{section:curve_design_process} is applied. With Spiro splines, the modelling is fairly straightforward. The user supplies a set of points for which the software computes an interpolating spline. The fairness measure chooses the segments of this spline to be parts of the Euler spiral and makes sure that there is \(G^2\) continuity and no excessive winding.

				We analyze Spiro splines in terms of the criteria presented in section \ref{section:usability_criteria_curve_design_tools}. The specification language of Spiro splines being simply points on the curve, plus the fact that on sufficiently smooth curves, not very many of them being needed, the language is well-suited to be read and spoken by humans (criteria 2 and 3). The fairness measure leads to beautifully smooth curves that are ususally sufficiently close to what a human would expect given the control points (criterion 4). The software is also good and sufficiently quick at constructing these curves (there are some cases where the algorithm fails to find a meaningful curve, but these cases are fairly artificial and can usually be avoided when designing actual curves) and thus fulfills criterion 5 well enough.

				The only real issue lies in the insufficient expressiveness of the specification language. Section \ref{section:bézier_splines} discussed how the lack of ability to specify curvature using common Bézier spline design tools adversively affects usability. Many of the same points apply to Spiro spline design tools, since they allow the user to neither specify direction nor curvature. These properties can only be expressed indirectly, by placing the control points in such a way that the algorithm will create a curve that has the desired properties, resulting in the usability issues described previously, such as requiring many control points to be specified even though the curve could be described much more concisely in terms of direction and/or curvature. This seems especially unfortunate when considering that the spline primitive of Spiro splines, the Euler spiral, would lend itsself excellently to describing circular arcs, spirals and other shapes exhibiting constant or linearly changing curvature. Sometimes, the algorithm can be coaxed into producing the desired curve by placing just a few control points very carefully, resulting in a series of Euler spiral segments that exhibit the wanted properties. Unfortunately, this is rarely practical since it both requires a lot of time to set up and doesn't behave very well when modified. These issues are somewhat alleviated by the guaranteed \(G^2\) continuity together with the general tendency of the algorithm to produce extremely smooth curves even when many control points are involved. That way, when indirectly specifying direction and/or curvature by placing many control points, it's not as easy to accidently create small bumps as with Bézier splines.

					\label{figure:usability_spiro}
				\end{figure}

				% TODO: improve example index numbers
				Figure \ref{figure:usability_spiro} illustrates some of these issues by showing some examples of Spiro splines as they appear in common design tools. Control points are displayed as filled dots.

				Example 1 shows a shape that is in principle well-suited for being represented by parts of the Euler spiral. Unfortunately, describing the curve using Spiro splines still requires many control points. In contrast to the corresponding example in section \ref{section:bézier_splines}, the curve in this example is close to a perfect spiral an thus does not match the source image perfectly. Additional control points would have to be added in order to approximate the imperfect spiral in the source image better.

				Example 2 shows how some shapes can be described using Spiro splines by placing only very few control points. In this case, the shape consists of a circular arc with low curvature (segment a), a segment of linearly increasing curvature (segment b) and finally a circular arc with high curvature (segment c). This shape can be described conveniently using a Spiro spline with just 4 control points.

				Unfortunately, as can be seen in example 3, this scenario does not handle modifications very well. For instance, increasing the curvature of segment c has to be done indirectly by moving a control point. Unfortunately, in this case, this also changes the direction of the curve at that point, such that additional modifications would be needed to correct this. The change also adversely affects segment a, since the curvature there was not specified directly but instead relied on the rather fragile configuration of the 4 control points.

	\section{Proposed Solution}
	\label{section:proposed_solution}

		Having analyzed the usability aspect of curve design tools, it's time to think about how to properly address their current issues. In the following sections, we propose both an abstract approach for designing a usability-oriented curve design tool, as well as our specific ideas for developing a piece of software using this approach.

		\subsection{Specification-Based Curves}
		\label{section:specification-based_curves}

			Seeing how the specification language and fairness measure almost completely determine all usability aspects of the resulting curve design tool, it seems unwise to choose them based on low-level mathematical aspects of the curve as is the case with Bézier splines. Spiro splines are much better in that a lot of effort was put into the fairness measure. Unfortunately, the project has set out to solve the problem of constructing interpolating splines, thereby committing to a very restricted specification language right from the start.

			We think that in order to get the best usability, using a good specification language which does not rely on implementation details has to be the top priority. Since it is not immediately clear which specification language is the best, the first step is to move away from the traditional explicit curve construction, and instead use a process that enables the creation of curves based on some specification and some fairness measure.

			\begin{figure}[htb]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../resources/specification-based_curves.pdf}
				\caption{Specification-Based Curves}
				\label{figure:specification-based_curves}
			\end{figure}

			Figure \ref{figure:specification-based_curves} shows such a process. Note that many specifics are still left undetermined in this approach since the previous usability analysis didn't give a complete answer as to what the optimal curve design tool looks like. It has yet to be determined what the specification language and fairness measure should be, whether to do segmentation (spline approach) or use a single parametric curve, or if the curve should be determined by numerical optimization or by explicit construction. These choices will be dealt with in the following section.

		\subsection{Nonlinear Optimization on Polynomial Curves}
		\label{section:nonlinear_optimization_polynomial_curves}

			After having established the general approach to curve design tools that the usability analysis seems to suggest in section \ref{section:specification-based_curves}, it's time to decide on the specifics in order to create an instance of this model.

			The goal of this project is to figure out which specification language and fairness measure yield the best usability in the resulting curve design tool. In order to achieve this goal, we decided to use nonlinear optimization on polynomial splines, that is, the curves are splines built from parametric polynomial curves which are connected with \(G^2\) continuity and whose parameters are determined using nonlinear optimization on some objective function determined by the specification and the fairness measure. This approach allows us to conveniently experiment with different specification languages and fairness measures in order to assess their usability.

			\subsubsection{Specification Language}
			\label{section:specification_language}

				The specification language we propose uses differential geometric properties of curves and is thus decoupled from specifics of the underlying curve model, hopefully leading to a specification language that is easier to learn and use. The human visual system seems to be fairly insensitive to curve properties beyond the second derivative, so the specification language will use points on the curve (denoted \(p\)), tangent angles (denoted \(\theta\)) of the curve as well as the curvature value (denoted \(\kappa\)) of the curve. In order to provide the maximum flexibility, the specification language should allow to specify any combination of these three properties.

				With point specifications, it's sometimes enough to require the curve to go through all of them in order, although sometimes, this will lead to undesirable results. Even with the curve preserving the order in which the points are visited, it is unspecified how much arc length the curve will spend between each pair of points. When specifying tangent angles and/or curvature values without an associated point, it becomes a necessity to associate this specification with some kind of positional information in order to anchor it to some point on the curve. If this was not done, the specification could move freely along the curve and would thus behave very unpredictably. We thus chose to associate each combination of point, tangent angle and curvature value with a position on the curve.

				With that in mind, it is now possible to abandon this notion of a combination of point, tangent angle and curvature value and instead talk about specification items, a specification item being either a positioned point, a positioned tangent angle or a positioned curvature value. A combination of point and curvature value at some position thus splits up into a point specification item at this position and a curvature specification item at the same position.

				An obvious choice for specifying a position on a curve would be by giving a parameter value for the underlying parametric curve. However, this would violate our design idea of using differential geometric properties of curves. A way of specifying a position on a curve that is independent from its parametrization is the arc length of the curve. Instead of directly using the arc length to give the positions of specification items, we chose to specify positions as fractions of the total arc length of the curve. This way, the position of a specification item relative to the start and end points of the curve is independent of the total arc length of the curve.

				With this setup, it seems advisable to also include the curve's total arc length in the specification. This way, one can specify curves that don't have any specification items associated to their start and end points. Also, with unspecified curve length, changing any specification item may inadvertently change the curve's total arc length, thus possibly adversely affecting other parts of the curve whose specification item positions are given as a fraction of the curve's total arc length.

				Thus, the final specification language is as follows:
				\begin{align*}
					\text{Positions} & = \left[0, 1\right]\\
					\text{Points} & = \mathbb{R}^2\\
					\text{Directions} & = \mathbb{R}\\
					\text{Curvatures} & = \mathbb{R}\\
					\text{SpecificationItems} & = \text{Positions} \times \left(\text{Points} \cup \text{Directions} \cup \text{Curvatures}\right)\\
					\text{CurveLengths} & = \mathbb{R}\\
					\text{Specifications} & = \mathcal{P}\left(\text{SpecificationItems}\right) \times \text{CurveLengths}
				\end{align*}

			\subsubsection{Fairness Measure}
			\label{section:fairness_measure}

				% TODO: add citations

				Many different fairness measures for plane curves have been proposed throughout history. Most of them set out to emulate the behavior of mechanical splines made from wood or steel, like those which were used for industrial design before the advent of computer aided design. The most direct approach of this type uses mechanics to derive a term for the energy in a bent steel band, arriving at the following functional describing the minimum energy curve (MEC):
				\begin{displaymath}
					\int_{0}^{1}{\kappa\!\left(t\right)}^2\;\mathrm{d}t
				\end{displaymath}

				While this approach is a good idealization of the mechanical spline, it has some disadvantages when used for curve design. For instance, it will not yield a circular arc when constrained by co-circular points. Thus, there has also been some research into fairness measures whose design is more directly motivated by the human perception of smoothness in plane curves. One such approach is that of the minimum variation curve (MVC), whose functional is given below:
				\begin{displaymath}
					\int_{0}^{1}{\kappa'\!\left(t\right)}^2\;\mathrm{d}t
				\end{displaymath}

				Minimum variation curves capture the intuitive notion of smoothness very well. The functional will put straight lines through points that are co-linear and circular arcs through points that are co-circular when otherwise unconstrained. When constraints cause different points on the curve to have different curvatures, the functional will prefer linearly changing curvture, since that will make the derivation of the curvature a constant and thereby minimize the integral over the square fo the derivative of the curvature.
